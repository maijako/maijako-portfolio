# My Portfolio Website

## Description

This is a code for my [Portfolio Website](https://maijako.github.io/maijako-portfolio) to showcase my skills and projects as a web developer.

It was built to fit wider and smaller screens by implementing responsive design elements, such as:

+ Flexbox
+ CSS Grid
+ Media query 

Allowing the application to render as follows on wider screens:

# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description
 
This is a refactored code for the [Horiseon marketing agency website](https://maijako.github.io/horiseon-code-refactor/) to make it more accessible and optimized for search engines.

The refactored code follows accessibility standards and includes relevant metadata and semantic html tags for search engine optimization.

All of the changes made during refactoring are reflected in comments.

The final mock up of the website looks the same as the original, but loads faster and includes functioning links in the navigation bar:

## Usage

The code and the comments in it could be used as an example during an introductory HTML and CSS coding lesson for beginners. 

It could also be used to demonstrate principles of good accessibility and SEO practice.
