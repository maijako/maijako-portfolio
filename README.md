# My Portfolio Website

## Description

This is a code for my [Portfolio Website](https://maijako.github.io/maijako-portfolio) to showcase my skills and projects as a web developer.

It was built to fit wider and smaller screens by implementing responsive design elements, such as:

+ Flexbox
+ CSS Grid
+ Media query 

Allowing the application to render as follows on wider screens:

And on smaller screens:

## Usage

The website as of today can be used as an example of organizing a personal portfolio.

It will be used to showcase my work and projects as a developer.
